/**
 * YOU SHOULD NOT NEED TOÂ MODIFYÂ THEÂ CODEÂ IN THISÂ SCRIPT.
 *
 * YOU SHOULD WRITE THE CODEÂ FOR THEÂ player FUNCTIONÂ IN
 * THE SCRIPT Challenger/player.js.
 *
 * The game of Nim starts with a given array of tokens:
 * 
 *   stateOfPlay = [1, 3, 5, 7]
 * 
 * Players take turns to reduce one of the entries in the
 * stateOfPlay array by one or more, up to the current
 * value of that entry. The player who takes the last
 * token, and so reduces stateOfPlay to [0, 0, 0, 0], is
 * the _loser_.
 * 
 * Your function in Challenger/player.js should return
 * an object with the format...
 * 
 *   { take: X, fromRow: Y }
 * 
 * ... where Y is a number between 0 and 3, which
 * defines the index of the entry in stateOfPlay that
 * you want to change, and X is a value between 1 and
 * the current value of stateOfPlay[Y].
 * 
 * Failure to return an object with valid keys and
 * values will end the game.
 * 
 * TUTORIALS *******************************************
 * You can play an interactive version of the game here:
 * https://withkoji.com/~blackslate/nim
 * 
 * Open the hamburger menu and select the checkboxes in
 * the Use Hints Against The AI section to learn the
 * winning strategy, by playing against the AI.
 * 
 * You can also follow a tutorial on how to build a
 * simple version of this game as a web app:
